# Router1x3
Designed a 1x3 Router in Verilog, integrating sub-components with Xilinx ISE and verifying RTL quality using Synopsys VC Spyglass. Developed a UVM testbench in SystemVerilog with 1 source and 3 destination agents, achieving 100% functional coverage, 66.66% assertion pass rate, and 50% code coverage. Enhanced accuracy through waveform analysis.
